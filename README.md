# SeleniumProject

introduction 
This is my first test automation project based on Selenium-Webdriver with Python. It's still developing package of automated tests of skleptest.pl demo website. The collection of tests contains:
    *Register user test
    *Login user tests
    *Adding item do cart 

Getting Started
To enjoy the automated tests, develop the framework or adapt it to your own purposes, just download the project or clone repository. You need to install packages using pip according to requirements.txt file. Run the command below in terminal:

$ pip install -r requirements.txt


Run Automated Tests
To run selected test without Allure report you need to set pytest as default test runner in Pycharm first

File > Settings > Tools > Python Integrated Tools > Testing
After that you just need to choose one of the tests from "tests" directory and click "Run test" green arrow.
